    content: `I would like to sincerely thank NexMinds for their invaluable guidance and support throughout the development and presentation of my graduation project, "Face Detection Door Lock System using OpenCV". The system opens the gate only when a known face is detected. If an unknown face is detected, the gate remains locked, a buzzer is activated, and a Telegram alert is sent for added security.\nThe team at NexMinds not only helped me with the technical aspects but also encouraged me to understand the real-world applications and challenges of such systems. Iâ€™m grateful for their mentorship, expertise, and commitment to student success.`,
